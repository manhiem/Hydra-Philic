Game for a cause :earth_asia:

# What are we doing?
We have built a 2D platformer that can educate students on harms caused by global warming, acid rains and other disasters. The pure inspirations of this game are pixelated games like DEAD CELLS, HOLLOW KNIGHT AND BROFORCE. Playing these games have motivated us thoroughly and we gave changed story by adding a certain lore tthat revolves around Earth!

Drawing on the theory of playful successes of using gamification as a motivating and behavioral change tool, we have adopted gamification (which is a combination of game dynamics, behavioral economics, and motivational psychology), an innovative strategy for fostering user-engagement and help solve the above problem. Now, at its core gamification is about engaging people on an emotional level and motivating them to accomplish goals for the greater good.

# About the Game:
Within 24 hours of the Hackathon HackSRM 3.0, we have built a 2D platformer that can showcase how gamified learning is fun, interactive and can educate students 40 times better than the general classroom teaching. The inspiration of this platformer is games like BROFORCE, DEAD CELLS AND HOLLOW KNIGHT. Where the game gradually moves forward the more deeper the story goes.
